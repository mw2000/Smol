# Introduction

This project is a static website generator, aimed specifically for college students to show off their CV and having a brief description about themselves. Its pretty light code, specifically made to match the style and template of http://mihir-wadekar.me/

# Motivation

After hearing positive feedback on my own personal website, I wanted the custom template available for everyone. Apart from this, my template is lightweight, easy and can easily be a starting point for any university student.

# Usage
- First, you would need to create your own profile.json file. I have provided a sample profile.json for you, please edit it and fill in your own information. (This will be easier in the future when we make a CLI)
- Second, create your own Avatar from https://avatarmaker.com/ and download the avatar in jpg format.
- Third, Move your profile.json, Avatar.jpg and gen.py files to the directory where you would like your website to be in.
- Enter the command ``` python3 gen.py``` and voila, you have your own static website!
